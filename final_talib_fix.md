# Final Instructions for Fixing TA-Lib Installation

I've analyzed your VM setup and found that the TA-Lib C libraries are already installed, but the Python wrapper is missing from your virtual environment. Follow these steps to fix the issue:

## Step 1: Connect to your VM

```bash
ssh henry@65.21.187.63
```

## Step 2: Run the TA-Lib wrapper installation script

```bash
bash ~/install_talib_wrapper.sh
```

This script will:
1. Activate your virtual environment
2. Install necessary dependencies (numpy, cython, etc.)
3. Install the TA-Lib Python wrapper
4. Verify the installation

## Step 3: Install the remaining requirements

After the TA-Lib wrapper is installed, install the remaining requirements:

```bash
cd ~/freqai_optimization
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Step 4: Run your FreqAI bot

Once all dependencies are installed, you can run your bot:

```bash
cd ~/freqai_optimization
screen -S freqai
./run_bot.sh
```

To detach from the screen session (without stopping the bot), press:
- `Ctrl+A`, then press `D`

## If You Still Encounter Issues

If you still have problems with TA-Lib, try the more comprehensive installation script:

```bash
bash ~/install_talib.sh
```

This script will reinstall the TA-Lib C libraries and the Python wrapper from scratch.

## Checking for Port Conflicts

If you encounter issues with port 8081 being in use when starting the bot, find and kill the process:

```bash
sudo lsof -i :8081
sudo kill -9 <PID>
```

## Monitoring Your Bot

To check if your bot is running properly:

```bash
tail -f ~/freqai_optimization/freqai_strategy.log
```
